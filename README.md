As part of my internship at Unified Mentor Private Limited, I delved deep into Amazon's sales data, unraveling valuable insights for informed decision-making.
🔍 Proposed Work:
1) Data Cleaning: Conducted minor adjustments to enhance data cleanliness. Employed basic Excel functions to rectify date formatting discrepancies.
2) Data Processing: Organized and refined columns within the Excel sheet, eliminating any null entries for improved data integrity.
3) Data Analysis: Extracted key performance indicators (KPIs) from the Excel dataset to unveil valuable insights.
4) Data Visualization/Dashboard Creation: Leveraged Microsoft Power BI to create visually compelling representations of the data, facilitating comprehensive data interpretation and decision-making.

💡My Insights:
1) In my analysis, I found that the total revenue amounted was $137.35 million, with a total profit of $44.17 million and a total cost of $93.18 million. 2) The average profit margin and unit price is calculated at $32.16 and $276.76, respectively.
3) Among product categories, "Cosmetics" emerged as the highest-selling category, while "Fruits" recorded the lowest sales.
4)Notably, the year 2012 witnessed the highest sales revenue, totaling $31.90 million. 
5)Within the Sub-Saharan Africa region, sales peaked at $39.67 million, with the "Office Supplies" category contributing approximately $10.5 million in revenue. This indicates an opportunity to expand operations in underserved areas within Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for "Office Supplies."
6) Additionally, my analysis revealed a significant demand for the “Cosmetics” category products among European consumers, resulting in the highest profit generation of $11.08 million. Hence, initiating targeted marketing campaigns promoting cosmetic products could further capitalize on this trend.
7) Conversely, the "Fruits" category experienced the lowest sales across all regions. To address this, I recommend launching marketing initiatives highlighting the freshness and quality of Amazon's fruit offerings, thereby enhancing the profit-to-cost ratio.
